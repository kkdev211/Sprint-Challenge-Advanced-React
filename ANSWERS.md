- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class Components are still seen in a lot of coding because the use of hooks in functional components is still relatively new but extending that- there is more logic in class components because you can use the react lifecycle within the component. Compared to functional components which accept data and display it.

Mounting- the component is building, render is invoked
Updating- updating component data, changes to props or state
Unmounting- removing component from the screen
